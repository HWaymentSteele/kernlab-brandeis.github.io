The paper "Structure determination of high-energy states in a dynamic protein ensemble"
that describes methodology to combine pseudo contacts shifts and CPMG relaxation
dispersion experiments to determine high-energy protein structures has appeared in
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04468-9">Nature</a>.

Congratulations to first-author <a href="/alumni/#John+Stiller">John Stiller</a>
and everyone else involved on a great story. The project was a collaboration
with <a href="https://theobald.brandeis.edu">Doug Theobald at
Brandeis University</a> and
<a href="https://haeussinger.chemie.unibas.ch/en/group/daniel-haeussinger">
Daniel HÃ¤ussinger's lab at the University of Basel, Switzerland</a>.
