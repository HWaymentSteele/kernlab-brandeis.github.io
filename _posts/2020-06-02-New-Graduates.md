The Brandeis University commencement on May 24th was certainly different than
usual because of the pandemic... Nevertheless, we are proud of the accomplishments
of the brand-new, Kern-lab graduates and hope to celebrate with them in person at
a later time!

Congratulations to <a href="/member/#Klarissa+Hollander">Klarissa Hollander</a> who
finished the BS/MS program (also for being elected to the Brandeis University chapter
of the <a href="https://www.brandeis.edu/now/2020/april/phi-beta-kappa-2020.html">
Phi Beta Kappa</a> honor society) and <a href="/member/#Liuyu+Chen">Liuyu Chen</a>
who obtained her Master degree.

On behalf of the Kern-lab-family: congratulations, enjoy a little break, and all
the best on your next adventures!
