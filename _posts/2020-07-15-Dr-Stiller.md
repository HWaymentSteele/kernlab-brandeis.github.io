Congratulations to <a href="/member/#John+Stiller">Dr. John Stiller</a>
who succesfully defendend his PhD thesis today!

In the first Kern-lab Zoom defense, John gave an excellent talk entitled
"Beyond the Ground State: High Energy Structural Determination". After
about an hour of behind-closed-doors interrogation by his thesis committee,
we held a small virtual event to celebrate his accomplishments.

John will stay around for a bit longer in the Kern-lab and hopefully we
will be able to organize an in-person, pre-pandemic-style party in
the not too far future.

Cheers to Dr. Stiller!
