Congratulations to <a href="/alumni/#Patrick+Finneran">Dr. Patrick Finneran</a>
who successfully defended his PhD thesis already on August 17!

Patrick presented about "Resurrecting Ancient Kinases To Understand the Evolution of Kinase Specificity and Regulation"
and did a terrific job explaining his thesis work to a large Zoom-audience.

Dr. Finneran started his new job as Senior Scientist Biophysics at Menten AI and on behalf of the Kern-lab family:
best of luck to you in your new job and we know you'll do great Patrick!
