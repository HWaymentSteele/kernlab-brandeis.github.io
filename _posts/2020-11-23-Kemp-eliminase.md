Our paper entitled <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abd3623">"How directed evolution reshapes the energy landscape in an enzyme to boost catalysis"</a> has appeared ahead of print on the Science website. In collaboration with the <a href="https://protein.ethz.ch/">Hilvert lab @ ETH Zurich</a>, we show the molecular origins of how directed evolution resulted in the fastest Kemp eliminase to-date. Congratulations to all involved!
