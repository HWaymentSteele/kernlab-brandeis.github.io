Joseph graduated last weekend with a BS in Biology and Biochemistry and a MS in Biology.
He finished his research project in the Kern lab with an excellent thesis talk and we are
sure he is fully prepared for his next step as a graduate student.

Congratulations, enjoy your break, and good luck in your PhD journey!
