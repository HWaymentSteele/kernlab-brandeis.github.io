  description: 'Motions are the basis for the function of biological macromolecules. Whereas for many enzymes the structures have been solved, very little is known about dynamic processes, which trigger catalysis. Our main goal is to characterize these motions in enzymes to provide a better understanding of the atomic events in enzyme catalysis as a function of time. We use NMR as a primary tool because it is an excellent method to measure dynamic processes ranging from picoseconds to days. We complement our experiments by computational techniques, namely, molecular dynamics simulations, which provide atomistic insight into the dynamics of macromolecules. Our aim is to reveal the physical mechanism of transitions by combining experimental to computational methods.'

  description: Over the past decade(s) it has been become increasingly evident that both a high-resolution structure and a detailed insight in its dynamics are of critical importance to understand the function of a biological macromolecule. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful techniques to study protein dynamics over a wide range of time scales and, moreover, can provide such information for many different nuclei with atomic resolution. I am interested in the development and application of NMR methodology to study protein structure/dynamics, with the goal to elucidate the intricate relationship between protein structure/dynamics and enzyme catalysis.

  description: Thirty-two non-receptor tyrosine kinases have been identified in humans. All of these kinases had evolved from the same common ancestor at one point in time. These proteins are similar by their function (kinase activity), but they differ in the mechanism in which they are regulated, and in their substrate specificity. I am interested in researching the mechanism of how a kinase is able to recognize its target protein. By using ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) it may be possible to map what evolutionary changes in the protein led to a difference in its specificity. I also research how regulatory abilities evolved over time using similar techniques.

  description: Protein’s exist upon a delicate energy landscape where multiple states are within several kJ of one another. While current structural techniques characterize the lowest energy conformation, the higher energy states remain obscured. However, recently NMR techniques have been developed which allows one to infer structural information about these excited states. With that in mind, my interests involve structurally investigating protein ensembles and discovering how regulation and drug binding are manipulated by conformational interexchange.

  description: Proteins are highly dynamic macromolecules that adopt various high-energy conformational states in solution to perform catalysis. These states are often fleeting and exist at low concentrations, which is why they are often thought of as subpopulations of a protein. Although X-ray crystallography has made recent advances in observing subpopulations, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy remains the most powerful instrument to understand the dynamic processes involved in the interconversion between major and minor conformational states. Therefore, my research interests lie in using NMR spectroscopy, to detect these subpopulations and understand how they contribute to protein regulation and catalysis.

  description: Adenylate kinase (ADK) is a phosphotransferase that regulates energy homeostasis by controlling intracellular nucleotide levels. ADK is an essential enzyme that is found across all domains of life, and its stability is correlated to organismal growth. This stability/fitness relationship imposes that ancestral ADK evolved modern sequences that are stable in the same environments occupied by their native organisms. I am interested in studying how ADK evolved by investigating the effects of mutations on the structural and dynamic properties of the enzyme using biophysical techniques such as X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy.
