  description: 'Motions are the basis for the function of biological macromolecules. Whereas for many enzymes the structures have been solved, very little is known about dynamic processes, which trigger catalysis. Our main goal is to characterize these motions in enzymes to provide a better understanding of the atomic events in enzyme catalysis as a function of time. We use NMR as a primary tool because it is an excellent method to measure dynamic processes ranging from picoseconds to days. We complement our experiments by computational techniques, namely, molecular dynamics simulations, which provide atomistic insight into the dynamics of macromolecules. Our aim is to reveal the physical mechanism of transitions by combining experimental to computational methods.'

  description: Proteins are highly dynamic macromolecules that adopt various high-energy conformational states in solution to perform catalysis. These states are often fleeting and exist at low concentrations, which is why they are often thought of as subpopulations of a protein. Although X-ray crystallography has made recent advances in observing subpopulations, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy remains the most powerful instrument to understand the dynamic processes involved in the interconversion between major and minor conformational states. Therefore, my research interests lie in using NMR spectroscopy, to detect these subpopulations and understand how they contribute to protein regulation and catalysis.

  description: Adenylate kinase (ADK) is a phosphotransferase that regulates energy homeostasis by controlling intracellular nucleotide levels. ADK is an essential enzyme that is found across all domains of life, and its stability is correlated to organismal growth. This stability/fitness relationship imposes that ancestral ADK evolved modern sequences that are stable in the same environments occupied by their native organisms. I am interested in studying how ADK evolved by investigating the effects of mutations on the structural and dynamic properties of the enzyme using biophysical techniques such as X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy.
